# Bépofle

This is my config for a wireless split sofle keyboard, using a [bépo layout](https://bepo.fr/wiki/Accueil) (equivalent of Dvorak for french).

As I do a lot of CAD and design work, the goal is to avoid as much as possible my right hand going back and forth between the mouse and the keyboard.
Hence the heavy focus on the left half.

A few points I could dig in later : homerow mods, numpad layer, custom layout for design/CAD.
